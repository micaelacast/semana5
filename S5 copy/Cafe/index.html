<h2>Colorful Eyeliner</h2>
</div>
<div class= "p">
<p>Colored eyeliner is one of my favorite ways to switch up my makeup lately. Finding shades outside of the usual blue, purple and green can be difficult, though. Many times, the formulas for more vibrant hues are streaky, too. Makeup artists on Instagram often use liquid lipstick in the place of a liner when they can't find one in their desired shade like red or teal. Finding liquid lipsticks that are eye safe can be difficult, though. Enter loose pigments. The seemingly messy beauty product is actually the perfect liner substitute. You just have to do some quick concocting.
When you mix a sprinkle or two of loose pigments with a couple drops of select liquids, you'll get a long-wearing liner in the color of your choice. The liquid you use is up to you, though. Some people use water, but your custom liner won't have peak staying power. Others use a setting spray, but let's be real, spritzing one can get all over everything but the area where you want it. Luckily, Redditors on the MakeupAddiction subreddit recently shared their favorite methods of transforming loose pigments into liner. These five concentrated and unexpected formulas ensures your new liner glides easily onto lids and stays put all day long, just like your favorite black liquid liner. </p> </div>

<h2> Vibrant Shadows</h2> 
</div>
<div class= "p">
<p>Celebrities are roaming outside of the typical lanes of smoky eyes and red lipstick on the red carpet in favor of more colorful, bold looks in 2018, and we are so here for it. Although nothing is wrong with those classic looks, we appreciate the unexpected makeup that has been happening lately. Rihanna, Bella Hadid, and Viola Davis have been inspiring us to be a bit more adventurous with our makeup routines with their colored liners, bold lipsticks, and vibrant eye shadow. Keep scrolling to check out seven fun makeup looks that we'll be recreating ASAP. Don't worry, the skills of a professional makeup artist Patrick Ta or Hung Vanngo aren't required for you to try them out, too. Margot Robbie's stunning white liner, in particular, is a simple way to switch up your go-to look. Without further ado, here are some of the best celebrity makeup looks of 2018. When makeup artist Vincent Oquendo got Hailey Baldwin ready for the Brit Awards, he took major cues from Rihanna. He payed homage to her iconic navy blue lipstick moment by using a lipstick from the singer's own beauty line: the Fenty Beauty Mattemoiselle Plush Matte Lipstick in Clapback. This trend will stay for long not only because it's really simple and easy, but it's the key to an editorial glam makeup look. </p>
